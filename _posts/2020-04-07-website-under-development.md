So, this site has been sitting here a while now. And that's totally my bad. We've had a couple of webinars and even a real meetup since we started last year, all of which we should have written about. I won't make any excuses but let me try to make it up to you guys, OK?

Luckily, this site is set up exactly like my own blog (which I also never update...) so it shouldn't be that hard to get this one up to speed as well. 

Make sure to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/norwegianpug) to keep up with day to day business. If you would like to hold a webinar or know anyone that's perfect for the tasks ship us a DM, an [electronic letter](mailto:post@npug.no) or tap the wires.
