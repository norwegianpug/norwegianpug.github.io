We are always looking for more speakers to help us by holding webinars on topics around PowerShell. Be it automation, development or just to show off cool projects created with PowerShell. We are also planning several meetups in Oslo, so if you are located or plan to be in Oslo feel free to reach out to us. 

We're obviously on twitter with the handle [@norwegianpug](https://twitter.com/norwegianpug), so we are able to receive direct messages there. Otherwise feel free to get in touch with Roberth or any of the other staffs through whatever means you have.

We're also available on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Norwegian-PowerShell-User-Group/).
